      <h1>Diff B/W Document & window objects</h1>
      <h3>Browser Object Model (BOM)</h3>
      <p>
        The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current
        browser window or tab. The topmost object in the BOM is the window
        object representing the window or tab or an iframe sometimes. Window
        object has properties like browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s
        screen etc. In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a
        single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and
        methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.
      </p>
      <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
      <p>
        When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model
        of the page. The document object represents the whole html document as a
        tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root
        element that represents the html document.
      </p>

      <i>above image shows difference between window and document.</i>
      <h3>Window Vs Document</h3>
      <p>
        <span>Window object :</span> It is the top most object and outermost
        element of the object hierarchy as shown in Figure 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Document object : </span> Each HTML document that gets loaded into
        a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents
        of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and
        delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page
      </p>
      <p>
        The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document
        where as document object is property of window object that points to the
        DOM document loaded in that window.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access a document object either using window.document property
        or using document object directly as window is global object. In the
        below example, title is the property of document object.
      </p>
      <img src="./Images/2.webp" id="img1" />
      <p>
        The other major difference is that both window object and document
        object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both
        objects but with different behavior. In the below example window.open()
        opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document
        within the window.
      </p>
      <img src="./Images/3.webp" id="img1" />
      <h3>Screen</h3>
      <p>
        Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen.
        It refers to screen object associated with that window object. Used to
        display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or
        screen object directly. Screen object doesn't have any methods as in
        window and document objects.
